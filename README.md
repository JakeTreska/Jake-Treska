## 🚀 About Me

I'm an aspiring test and research engineer with a background in computer science and applied AI. I’ve worked on cutting-edge machine learning pipelines—from classifying neurological patterns in MRI data to enhancing real-time video for drone surveillance. I enjoy building reliable, efficient systems, whether it's for autonomous navigation or image-text consistency evaluation.

Currently, I’m diving into 3D vision, point cloud processing, and multimodal AI. I'm especially excited by the intersection of ML and embedded systems for real-world applications in defense, healthcare, and aerospace.
